A couple years ago I wrote a PowerShell module starter kit (<a href="http://keithbabinec.com/2017/08/13/powershell-script-module-starter-kit/">here</a>). The goal was to provide an example for organizing a module using best practices and provide a live repository you could clone and play around with.

I've taken that starter kit module and updated it for 2019. Incorporating some new best practices and new usage patterns that I find helpful. Head over to the GitHub link to check it out!
